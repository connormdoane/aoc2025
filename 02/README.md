# Day 02

![Python code](python.png)

About as big of a ramp up in difficulty as I anticipated, definitely feels like a day 3 or even 4 from previous years.

Part 1 was quite simple, just divide the string in two and compare them

Part 2 required a complete refactoring, and I had to reason it from base cases (writing code for checking increments of 1, then 2, then 3, and using those to reason a wrapping for loop to automate the process for an arbitrary input length)
